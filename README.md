# CHEMBL_VS_dataset
Code in this repository allows to create a data set basing on ChEMBL database. This project is made in terms of my masters thesis. Resulting data set contains carefully selected protein targets that fullfilled several conditions, including both theoretical and physico-chemcial features. Each target also has assigned active/inactive/decoys sets.
